# Garden Finance SDK for Multi-Chain Real Estate Asset Tokenization Platform üå∏üí≤

The Garden SDK addresses a key challenge for Bitcoin holders who are traditionally unable to participate in standard dApp transactions. A compelling use case being developed is a Multi-Chain Real Estate Asset Tokenization Platform. This platform enables users to represent real estate assets, such as houses or bungalows, as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across multiple blockchains, including the Core DAO Testnet and Ethereum Sepolia Testnet.
